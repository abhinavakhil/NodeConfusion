1) What is Symmetric Key Cryptography
    -Shared secret key between the two parties
    Flow
        Sender->send(message + Secret Key) 
            ----> Encrypted Message (Malicious Third party cann't decrypt) ---->
        Receiver->receive(message + Secret Key)

2) Public Key Cryptography
    -Asymmetric Encryption
        - Public key that can be widely distributed
        - Private key that is only known to the Receiver
        Flow
            Sender(Message + Public Key)
                ----> Encrypted Message (Malicious Third party cann't decrypt) ---->
            Receiver(Message + Private key)

1) go to bin folder
2) write following commands
    openssl genrsa 1024 > private.key
    openssl req -new -key private.key -out cert.csr
    openssl x509 -req -in cert.csr -signkey private.key -out certificate.pem
